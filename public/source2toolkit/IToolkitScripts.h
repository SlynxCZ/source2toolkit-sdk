/**
 * @file IToolkitScripts.h
 * @brief Interface for running cs_script (the game's server-side JavaScript).
 *
 * CS2 runs map and mode logic in JavaScript through `point_script` entities
 * (`import { Instance } from "cs_script/point_script"`). This interface lets a
 * plugin run scripts of its own and talk to them:
 *
 * * run a compiled script asset (`.vjs`) the way a map does -- this needs no
 *   signature and keeps working through game updates;
 * * run raw JavaScript source, or a `.js` file straight from the server's
 *   disk, and run it again after an edit (hot reload);
 * * fire an input a script listens for with `Instance.OnScriptInput(...)`
 *   (native -> script);
 * * receive what a script sends with `Instance.ServerCommand(...)`
 *   (script -> native);
 * * keep a script alive across round restarts and map changes.
 *
 * A script sends a message with
 * @code
 * Instance.ServerCommand("toolkit_script mychannel " + encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(data)));
 * @endcode
 * and every handler registered for `mychannel` receives everything after the
 * channel name. The line goes through the server's command buffer: it arrives
 * on a later tick, a `;` or a newline in it would split it into two commands,
 * and it is cut at the buffer's line limit -- encode the payload (as above)
 * and keep it short. Only the server itself can run `toolkit_script`; a
 * client typing it is ignored.
 *
 * @note Everything here belongs on the main thread.
