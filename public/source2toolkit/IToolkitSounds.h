/**
 * @file IToolkitSounds.h
 * @brief Interface for playing, stopping and rewriting sound events.
 *
 * A sound event reaches a client as one network message
 * (CMsgSosStartSoundEvent): the hash of its name, the entity it plays from, a
 * guid and a packed block of parameters. This interface builds and sends that
 * message itself instead of going through an entity on the server, which is
 * what makes the rest possible:
 *
 * * a sound goes to exactly the players you pick -- nobody else receives it,
 *   so there is nothing for them to hear;
 * * Emit() hands back the guid, and the guid stops the sound at once or changes
 *   its parameters while it plays;
 * * volume channels: a player's own volume for "music", "effects" or whatever a
 *   plugin names is applied per recipient, so a player turns the server's
 *   music down in a menu instead of fighting snd_musicvolume;
 * * every sound the game itself starts passes through HookSound(), where it
 *   can be blocked, renamed, re-parametrised or re-addressed.
 *
 * @note Everything here belongs on the main thread.
