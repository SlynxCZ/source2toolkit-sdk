/**
 * @file IToolkitTransmit.h
 * @brief Interface for deciding which entities each player receives.
 *
 * Every tick the server works out, per player, the set of entities to send
 * (CheckTransmit). This interface sits after that decision and takes entities
 * back out of it:
 *
 * * an entity is hooked once, and from then on has a visibility per viewer --
 *   hidden from some players, shown to others, with up to eight independent
 *   "channels" so two features (a !hide command, a spectator mode, a
 *   team-only marker) can each hide the same entity without stepping on
 *   each other's toes: the entity shows only when no channel hides it;
 * * a player is hidden through their controller: hiding a controller from a
 *   viewer hides the pawn that controller is driving, the observer pawn and a
 *   dead player pawn, while the controller itself stays -- the scoreboard
 *   keeps working;
 * * an entity can be tied to an owner entity, and then disappears wherever
 *   its owner is hidden (a player's weapons, a beam attached to them);
 * * BlockAll takes an entity away from everybody, the one-line "server-side
 *   only" switch;
 * * and for anything that does not fit the model, HookCheckTransmit() hands
 *   over each viewer's transmit set, wrapped, so a plugin never has to lay
 *   out CCheckTransmitInfo itself.
 *
 * Hiding is done the way the client expects: the entity leaves the transmit
 * set and is put on the "non-transmitted" list at the same time, so the
 * client keeps a record of it while it is hidden and takes it back without
 * the "missing client entity" crash when it comes back. Both of those bits
 * are what IToolkitTransmitInfo::BlockTransmit() does.
 *
 * @note Everything here belongs on the main thread.
