/**
 * @brief One "panel has CSS class" entry of a custom HUD layout state.
 *
 * Hand-written, not schema-generated: these are value types that we construct
 * ourselves and hand to an engine-owned CUtlVector, so the C++ layout has to be
 * the engine's real one. A SCHEMA_FIELD wrapper carries no storage -- the class
 * would be 3 bytes wide against the engine's 8, and both the stack instance and
 * every AddToTail()/Element() stride would be wrong.
 *
 * @note Panel and class names are not stored here; the two indices point into
 *       CCSCustomHudLayout's m_vecPanelIds / m_vecClassNames string tables.
